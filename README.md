🎮 ESL Archive for Counter-Strike & More

Welcome to the ESL Archive Project – a digital preservation effort focused on collecting, organizing, and maintaining legacy ESL (Electronic Sports League) files from historic competitive play. This includes configuration files, mappools, rulesets, and other tournament-related resources for games like Counter-Strike 1.6, CS:S, CS:GO, and more.

📦 What You’ll Find

This repository serves as a historical archive and currently includes:

✅ ESL Config files (match configs, league rules, etc.)

📋 Mappools from different seasons and tournaments

🗂️ Legacy documentation and tournament assets

We aim to preserve the competitive legacy of esports and provide resources for retro tournaments, LAN parties, or research purposes.
